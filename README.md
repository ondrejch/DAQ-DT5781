# DAQ-DT5781
DAQ system for CAEN DT-5781 with DPP-PHA firmware. USB connection is assumed.

Each subdirectory contains a version of the DAQ.
"odaq" is a simple excerise in plain C developed to learn how to talk to the digitizer and use the DPP library.
"spigs" and "fpigs" contain single- and four- channel versions of the DAQ writen in C++ using ROOT/C++ framework, both are GUI based.
The single channel version was developed first. Once working, the four channel version was forked and this version is being further developed.
